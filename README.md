# 🎬 IMDb SQL Project – Learning SQL with Real-World Movie Data

This project includes a set of SQL queries written to explore and analyze a movie database inspired by IMDb. It is designed as a **learning tool** to practice SQL using real-world data challenges.

All queries are written in a **single SQL file** and are clearly separated by comments indicating the question they answer.

## 🎯 What I Will Practice

- Filtering data with `WHERE` and `LIKE`
- Joining tables using `JOIN`
- Aggregating data with `GROUP BY`, `COUNT`, `AVG`
- Sorting and limiting data with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`
- Writing subqueries and using `IN`, `EXISTS`
- Handling duplicates with `DISTINCT`

## 💡 Sample Questions Covered

- What movies were released in a specific year?
- Who acted in a given movie?
- Which movies received the highest ratings?
- Which director worked on top-rated films?
- Which actors co-starred with a particular person?
- How does the average rating vary by year or genre?
